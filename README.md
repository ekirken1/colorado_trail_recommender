# Motivation and Background

Since this project's inception, I have had the goal to build a recommendation system to help me, and hopefully others, discover new hikes to go on. As a continuation to the first part of this [project](https://github.com/rumbelievable/colorado_hiking), I wanted to build out a content-based recommender using a variation of the topics I discovered along with features originally taken during data collection.
